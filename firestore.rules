/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for VendaZap AI application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Each user can only access their own data stored under their unique user ID.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All user data is nested under the /users/{userId} collection.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed for privacy.
 * - The rules strictly enforce that the authenticated user's UID matches the {userId} path parameter for all operations.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The user's UID is implicitly denormalized into the document path (/users/{userId}), eliminating the need for a separate `uid` field within the document and the associated read operations to verify ownership.

     * @allow (get, update, delete) - Authenticated user with UID 'user123' can access, update, or delete their own profile at /users/user123.
     * @deny (create, get, update, delete) - Authenticated user with UID 'user456' cannot access or modify profile data at /users/user123.
     * @principle Enforces strict user ownership for data access.
